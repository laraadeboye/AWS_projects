# Creating and Hosting a Wordpress website on an EC2 instance

This project will set up a WordPress website on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. Hosting a website on EC2 provides the following benefits:

* Customization: Gain full control over the server environment and website configuration.
* Scalability: Easily scale resources (CPU, memory) as website traffic grows.
* Cost-efficiency: Pay only for the resources you use

**Problem:** ExampleOrganicsCompany, a local farmers market, lacked an online presence to showcase their products and connect with customers. They needed a user-friendly platform to manage their product catalog, receive online orders, and promote their offerings.

**My Role:** As a Cloud Architect, I will design and implement a scalable solution using AWS EC2. Launching an EC2 instance with appropriate resources, I configure a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to run WordPress, and install the WooCommerce plugin for e-commerce functionality.
