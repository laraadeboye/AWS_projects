# Visualize Data using Amazon Quicksight

**Problem**: ABC Company, a retail business, struggled to gain insights from their scattered sales data. They needed a centralized and interactive platform to visualize key metrics and identify trends to make data-driven decisions.

**My Role**: As a AWS professional, I will Amazon QuickSight to create a comprehensive sales dashboard. I will connect QuickSight to various data sources (e.g., CRM, sales reports) and transform the data into a usable format.
